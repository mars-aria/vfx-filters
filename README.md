# VFX Filters

Broken Frame 🔨 : My broken_frame() function creates a fractured effect in the image below that I liken in appearance to the Distorted Glass filter in Photoshop. 

Film-Noir 🕵🏾‍♀️ : My film_noir() function transforms this image of the Strawhat Pirates from the manga "One Piece" by creating a black-and-white, vintage-style effect similar to the Grayscale filter in Photoshop. 

Monochrome 🐺 : My monochrome_filter() function transforms this image of the wolf character Legoshi from the manga "Beastars" into a formidable beast by adding a monochrome effect to his appearance.
