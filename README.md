# VFX Filters

**Broken Frame 🔨:** My broken_frame() function adds a fractured effect to an image similar to the Distorted Glass filter in Photoshop. 

**Film-Noir 🕵🏾‍♀️:** My film_noir() function transforms an image of the Strawhat Pirates from the manga "One Piece" by creating a black-and-white, vintage-style effect similar to the Grayscale filter in Photoshop. 

**Monochrome 🐺:** My monochrome_filter() function transforms an image of the wolf character Legoshi from the manga "Beastars" into a formidable beast by adding a monochrome effect to his appearance.
